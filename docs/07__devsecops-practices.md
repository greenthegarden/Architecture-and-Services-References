## Technologies

## Benefits of Continuous Delivery Pipeline (CDP)

> The CDP represents the workflows, activities, and automation needed to shepherd a new piece of functionality from ideation to an on-demand release of value to the end user.

### Continuous Delivery Foundation

> The [Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation) (CDF) serves as the vendor-neutral home of many of the fastest-growing projects for continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD). It fosters vendor-neutral collaboration between the industry’s top developers, end users and vendors to further CI/CD best practices and industry specifications. Its mission is to grow and sustain projects that are part of the broad and growing continuous delivery ecosystem.

Similarly to the Clound Native Computing Foundation landscape, the Continuous Delivery Foundation offers its own [interactive landscape](https://landscape.cd.foundation/).
