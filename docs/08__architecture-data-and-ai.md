## MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)

### Executive summary

MLOps is a combination of philosophies and practices that enable data science and IT operations teams to rapidly develop, deploy, maintain and scale Machine Learning models.

MLOps is derived from DevOps principles. The name MLOps is a combination of Machine Learning (ML) and operation (Ops). MLOps is a subset of ModelOps.

"MLOps or ML Ops is a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps).

Applying these practices of continuous improvement, collaboration, communication, and embracing automation improves product quality, simplifies management, and increases speed of delivery.

### Overview

MLOps is an approach to machine learning operations that considers and streamlines the entire process. The goal of MLOps is to manage resources, data, code, time and quality to meet business objectives and regulatory concerns.

Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) from DevOps are important processes in MLOps. However, there are some differences. To create a complete pipeline for MLOps, we introduce an additional discipline: Continuous training.

|  | DevOps | MLOps |
|---|---|---|
| Continuous Integration | Test and validate code and components. | Also test and validate data, data schemas, and models. |
| Continuous Deployment | Focus on a single software package or service. | Also consider the whole system: the ML training pipeline that should automatically deploy another service, or roll back changes from a model. |
| Continuous Training |  | Constantly monitor, retrain, and serve the model. |

#### Machine Learning Lifecycle

1. Data gathering/extraction
1. Data analysis
1. Data transformation/preparation
1. Model training & development
1. Model evaluation
1. Model validation
1. Model serving
1. Model monitoring
1. Model re-training

### Problems MLOps attempts to solve

It can be difficult to:

* track trained models.
* track all the different versions of code, values, and metrics.
* track which ideas have been tried, and the outcomes.
* reproduce the best model, and easily put it into production.

### Benefits and risks

Streamlining the entire machine learning process and introducing automation improves team performance and enables greater agility, while maintaining work quality. It also supports efficiency when updating a production model as new data comes in.
