## Waterfall development method overview

Introduced in 1977, the waterfall approach to software development uses distinct phases sequentially, commonly:

1. Requirements specification
1. System design
1. Implementation
1. Verification and testing
1. Deployment and maintenance.

The output of each phase is input for the next phase, and phases do not overlap. No phase ends until all phase deliverables are produced, and the process receives approval from defined stakeholders to proceed. Like water flowing down a waterfall, the workflow through the phases should be one-way.

### Projects suitable for Waterfall

Projects that:
* have clear requirements that will not change
* are small in scope that will not change.

### Waterfall phases

#### Requirements

All project requirements must be gathered and outlined in writing. The output from this phase is generally a single requirement specifications document, that describes each stage of the project, including costs, assumptions, risks, dependencies, success metrics, and timelines. One the requirements are approved by the required stakeholders, they shouldn't change.

#### Design

Using the product requirements, a system design is created. Architectures, solution designers, and developers design how the system will be built. A higher-level design is created first,  describing the flow of traffic between components, and integration points. Then a low-level design is created that specifies hardware and software technologies.

#### Implementation

Software developers create the code of the application. They usually develop in small sections called units, and each unit is also tested during this phase.

#### Verification or testing

Testing is done to ensure there are no errors, performance issues, security problems, and all the requirements have been met.

#### Deployment and maintenance

The software is deployed to customers. If defects are found or there are change or enhancement requests, there may be updates and new versions of the software that need to be created and released.

If an enhancement is large in scope, then the Waterfall process might begin again.

### Advantages of Waterfall

* Simple and well-defined methodology.
* Simple to manage and schedule in advance.
* Simple to measure progress using clearly defined milestones.
* After the requirements have been defined, the timeline and cost of the project can be accurately estimated.
* During the analysis and design phases developers can catch design errors, avoiding writing incorrect code during the implementation phases.
* Software developers joining a project in progress can get up to speed quickly because everything is outlined.
* Customers should not add new requirements, which would cause delays.

### Disadvantages of Waterfall

* High risk and uncertainty in projects that are medium, large, or complex.
* No working software until late in the process.
* In practice requirements often do change, which can become time-consuming, and costly.
* Does not allow for reflection or revision of design once implementation begins.
* May take longer to deliver then using an iterative approach, such as the Agile method.
* Clients may not fully know what they want from the beginning.
* Clients are not involved in the design and implementation phases.
* Deadline creep can occur when one phase is delayed, delaying future phases.
